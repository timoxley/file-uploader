# File Uploader

This module allows you to easily test the file uploading capabilities of
your API by allowing you to perform a multipart file upload programmatically. 

## Usage

```javascript

var uploader = require('file-uploader')

var file   // set to the path of the file you want to upload
var cookie // set a cookie if you require authorisation

var options = {
  host : 'localhost',
  port : 4000,
  path : '/upload',
  method : 'POST',
  encoding : 'utf8'
}

uploader.postFile(options, file, {Cookie: cookie}, function(err, res) {
  console.log(res.statusCode)
})

```

See tests for more details.

## TODO
Way more tests.
